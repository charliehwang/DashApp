To build DashApp you'll need an Intel Mac with XCode installed.

To run DashApp on real hardware (not just the emulator) you'll need a valid developer profile from the Apple Developer Program (at least, that's the only way I know how you can do it).

To build, double-click DashApp.xcodeproj and then click "Build & Run".
